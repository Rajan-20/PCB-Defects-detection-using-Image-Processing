# PCB-Defects-detection-using-Image-Processing

In this project, PCB inspection system the inspection algorithm manily focuses on the defect detection using the natural images.Two methods are approached for defect detection in image processing techniques. There are simple image subtraction and feature extraction methods.In our project we are used simple image subtraction method.we subtract the image manufacturing of PCB image from Reference Image. Now we get the error of the PCB board.
